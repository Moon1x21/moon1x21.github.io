Purdue international scholar

***

Thankfully, Got a chance to visit Purdue University as an international Scholar! My research is an Outdoor SLAM using a monocular camera! From April to August, I researched the SLAM and developed the algorithm! You can see the <a href="https://github.com/FarmVroong">whole project</a>.
