Purdue international scholar

***

Thanksfully, Got a chance to visit Purdue University as a international Scholar! My research is a Outdoor SLAM using monocular camera! From April to August, I will research about the SLAM and develop the algorithm! You can see the whole project <a href="https://github.com/FarmVroong">cold-pressed</a>.
